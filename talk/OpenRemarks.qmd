Gem City ML's goal is to have a space where people can present and learn new ML/AI ideas, ask for help on problems they are working on, and meet new people.

<br>


We have short talks about machine learning (ML) and how to get into this field.

<br>


The format is:

* Social: ~ 30 min
* Lecture: ~ 1 hour
* Social: ~ 30 min

Talks have ranged from MLOps, modeling CO2 to predict occupancy, to A/B Testing.

<br>
