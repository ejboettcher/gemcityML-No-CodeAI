This is done as a group.\n\nThen show them the test data (green paper) and see how well their model did.\nTest data (green paper)\n\nBiting: 22, 23, 24\nNon-biting: 21, 25 - 40\n\nAI Unplugged has more example in this paper\n\n\nML Explained (2.5 min)\nOverview Video on Machine Learning (~ 2 minutes)\nYouTube (very simple explanation)\n\n\nTrain Model (10 min)\nTrain Model with Teachable Machines.\n\nDemo how to train a model on Teachable Machine\nGive students 6-7 minutes to train their own.\n\nHave students go to Teachable Machine\nClick Get Started and start an image classification\nLet students create two class classification for any school acceptable hand jester.\n\nKeep the images simple\nname your classes something descriptive: Cat / Dog\nAsk how you could account for differences: skin color, jewelry, nail color.\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Models (10min)\n\nDownload model.\n\nShow students how to copy their model to a folder (static) in student_application_start,\nUpdate the URL in the my_model.js (line 5)\n\n(stretch) Show students how to add an image to the first “if” condition. (on line 64) (hint: look at the application_demo folder)\n\nUse Wikipedia images search for emojis\n\n(stretch) Ask how the Javascript syntax is different than the Python Syntax\n\n\n\nClosing\n\nHave each group Demo their application\nStudent Reflection:\n\nHow could you use ML application in your school, home, car?\nWhat would you have to consider when training a model?\n\nCelebrate: You created a working ML models!\n\nFollow-up Resources:\n\nAI Unplugged\nAI for ALl summer programs\nThe Code Train\nGoogle Tutorial"

Boettcher’s tutorial based on a Google Women Techmakers educational tutorial on how to make an image classifier application with No/Low Code.\nThis tutorial is designed to encourage kids to go into Computer Science by gently introducing them to AI and Machine learning. No Coding or ML experience needed.\nPlease bring a laptop. The goal of this tutorial is to walk you through the ML/AI concepts and build your own application that can recognize hand gestures, cat etc from a web camera.\nThis is a step-by-step guide to build an ML image application\n\n\n\nSubject\nImage\n\n\n\n\nTrain a model\n\n\n\nExport Model\n\n\n\nIntegrate Model"
